# SE311_SmartCityApplication
SE311 2020 Project 3 Smart City Application used to developed with design patterns.

## Which I used design patterns and Why? 
### 1. Singleton Pattern => 
---

According to the scenario should be have only one monitor.

### 2. Factory Method Pattern =>
---

According to the scenario, more than one has sensor type, also we need to provide created processes allocated by the client.

### 3. Iterator Pattern =>
---

According to our wishes, we created with operations which each on neighborhoods allows us to get around.

### 4. Composite Pattern =>
---

Since our neighborhood collection consists of streets, apartments and poles, I preferred this pattern because it is a hierarchical structure.

### 5. Observer Pattern =>
---

I chose this pattern to inform the citizens who will subscribe to the sensors on the apartments and poles that there is a change in any sensor value.

### 6. Command Pattern =>
---

I prefer this pattern because our engineer will have the structure of resetting the values on the apartment at the time it is requested, that is, she is responsible for performing a transaction.
